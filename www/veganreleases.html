<h1>Release plans</h1>

<p> <b>R 3.0.0</b> release is scheduled within the two first quarters
of 2013. We plan to release a new major version <b>vegan 2.2-0</b>
concurrently. At least one minor version of <b>vegan</b> will be
released before the major version.

<p>The major new features in <b>vegan 2.2-0</b> are:
<ul>
  <li> Support for parallel processing in several <b>vegan</b>
  functions, in particular in permutation procedures and also in
  <code>metaMDS</code> iteration.</li>

  <li> Completely redesigned more powerful and flexible community
  null models.
</ul>

<p>You can help in <b>vegan</b> development by testing the current
development version and reporting the problems to us. See the next
chapter for installing the development version.
