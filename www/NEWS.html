<h3>Changes in version 2.0-2</h3>




<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Function <code>capscale</code> failed if constrained component
had zero rank. This is most likely in partial models where the
conditions can alias constraints. This was manifest in
<code>anova(..., by ="margin")</code> which uses partial models to
analyses the marginal effects, and was raported in an email
message to
<a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2011-October/293077.html">R-News
mailing list</a>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>stressplot</code> and <code>goodness</code> sometimes failed when
<code>metaMDS</code> was based on <code>isoMDS</code> (<span class="pkg">MASS</span> package)
because <code>metaMDSdist</code> did not use same defaults for
step-across (extended) dissimilarities as <code>metaMDS(...,
     engine = "isoMDS")</code>. The change of defaults can also influence
triggering of step-across in <code>capscale(..., metaMDSdist =
     TRUE)</code>.
</p>
</ul>

  


<h3>Changes in version 2.0-1</h3>




<h4>NEW FUNCTIONS</h4>



<ul>
<li> <p><code>clamtest</code>: new function to classify species as
generalists and specialists in two distinct habitats (CLAM test of
Chazdon et al., <EM>Ecology</EM> 92, 1332&ndash;1343; 2011).  The test is
based on multinomial distribution of individuals in two habitat
types or sampling units, and it is applicable only to count data
with no over-dispersion.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>as.preston</code> gained <code>plot</code> and <code>lines</code>
methods, and <code>as.fisher</code> gained <code>plot</code> method (which
also can add items to existing plots). These are similar as
<code>plot</code> and <code>lines</code> for <code>prestonfit</code> and
<code>fisherfit</code>, but display only data without the fitted lines.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>raupcrick</code>: new function to implement Raup-Crick
dissimilarity as a probability of number of co-occurring species
with occurrence probabilities proportional to species
frequencies.  <span class="pkg">Vegan</span> has Raup-Crick index as a choice in
<code>vegdist</code>, but that uses equal sampling probabilities for
species and analytic equations. The new <code>raupcrick</code>
function uses simulation with <code>oecosimu</code>. The function
follows Chase et al. (2011) <EM>Ecosphere</EM> 2:art24
[<a href="http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/ES10-00117.1">doi:10.1890/ES10-00117.1</a>],
and was developed with the consultation of Brian Inouye.
</p>
</ul>

 


<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Function <code>meandist</code> could scramble items and give
wrong results, especially when the <code>grouping</code> was
numerical. The problem was reported by Dr Miguel Alvarez
(Univ. Bonn).
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>metaMDS</code> did not reset <code>tries</code> when a new model
was started with a <code>previous.best</code> solution from a different
model. 
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Function <code>permatswap</code> for community null models using
quantitative swap never swapped items in a <i>2 by 2</i>
submatrix if all cells were filled.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> The result from <code>permutest.cca</code> could not be
<code>update</code>d because of a &lsquo;<span class="file">NAMESPACE</span>&rsquo; issue.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> 2.14.0 changed so that it does not accept using
<code>sd()</code> function for matrices (which was the behaviour at
least since <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> 1.0-0), and several <span class="pkg">vegan</span> functions were
changed to adapt to this change (<code>rda</code>, <code>capscale</code>,
<code>simulate</code> methods for <code>rda</code>, <code>cca</code> and
<code>capscale</code>). The change in <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> 2.14.0 does not influence the
results but you probably wish to upgrade <span class="pkg">vegan</span> to avoid
annoying warnings.
</p>
</ul>
	
 


<h4>ANALYSES</h4>



<ul>
<li> <p><code>nesteddisc</code> is slacker and hence faster when trying
to optimize the statistic for tied column frequencies. Tracing
showed that in most cases an improved ordering was found rather
early in tries, and the results are equally good in most cases.
</p>
</ul>

 


<h3>Changes in version 2.0-0</h3>




<h4>GENERAL</h4>



<ul>
<li><p> Peter Minchin joins the <span class="pkg">vegan</span> team.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><span class="pkg">vegan</span> implements standard <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> &lsquo;<span class="file">NAMESPACE</span>&rsquo;. In
general, <code>S3</code> methods are not exported which means that you
cannot directly use or see contents of functions like
<code>cca.default</code>, <code>plot.cca</code> or <code>anova.ccabyterm</code>. To
use these functions you should rely on <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> delegation and simply
use <code>cca</code> and for its result objects use <code>plot</code> and
<code>anova</code> without suffix <code>.cca</code>. To see the contents of
the function you can use <code>:::</code>, such as
<code>vegan:::cca.default</code>. This change may break packages,
documents or scripts that rely on non-exported names.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><span class="pkg">vegan</span> depends on the <span class="pkg">permute</span> package. This
package provides powerful tools for restricted permutation
schemes. All <span class="pkg">vegan</span> permutation will gradually move to use
<span class="pkg">permute</span>, but currently only <code>betadisper</code> uses the new
feature. 
</p>
</ul>

 


<h4>NEW FUNCTIONS</h4>



<ul>
<li> <p><code>monoMDS</code>: a new function for non-metric
multidimensional scaling (NMDS). This function replaces
<code>MASS::isoMDS</code> as the default method in
<code>metaMDS</code>. Major advantages of <code>monoMDS</code> are that it
has &lsquo;weak&rsquo; (&lsquo;primary&rsquo;) tie treatment which means
that it can split tied observed dissimilarities.  &lsquo;Weak&rsquo;
tie treatment improves ordination of heterogeneous data sets,
because maximum dissimilarities of <i>1</i> can be split. In
addition to global NMDS, <code>monoMDS</code> can perform local and
hybrid NMDS and metric MDS.  It can also handle missing and zero
dissimilarities.  Moreover, <code>monoMDS</code> is faster than
previous alternatives. The function uses <code>Fortran</code> code
written by Peter Minchin.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>MDSrotate</code> a new function to replace
<code>metaMDSrotate</code>. This function can rotate both <code>metaMDS</code>
and <code>monoMDS</code> results so that the first axis is parallel to
an environmental vector.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>eventstar</code> finds the minimum of the evenness profile
on the Tsallis entropy, and uses this to find the corresponding
values of diversity, evenness and numbers equivalent following
Mendes et al. (<EM>Ecography</EM> 31, 450-456; 2008). The code was
contributed by Eduardo Ribeira Cunha and Heloisa Beatriz Antoniazi
Evangelista and adapted to <span class="pkg">vegan</span> by Peter Solymos.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>fitspecaccum</code> fits non-linear regression models to
the species accumulation results from <code>specaccum</code>. The
function can use new self-starting species accumulation models
in <span class="pkg">vegan</span> or other self-starting non-linear regression
models in <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>. The function can fit Arrhenius, Gleason, Gitay,
Lomolino (in <span class="pkg">vegan</span>), asymptotic, Gompertz,
Michaelis-Menten, logistic and Weibull (in base <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>) models. The
function has <code>plot</code> and <code>predict</code> methods.
</p>
</li>
<li><p> Self-starting non-linear species accumulation models
<code>SSarrhenius</code>, <code>SSgleason</code>, <code>SSgitay</code> and
<code>SSlomolino</code>. These can be used with <code>fitspecaccum</code> or
directly in non-linear regression with <code>nls</code>. These functions
were implemented because they were found good for species-area
models by Dengler (<EM>J. Biogeogr.</EM> 36, 728-744; 2009).
</p>
</ul>

 


<h4>NEW FEATURES</h4>



<ul>
<li> <p><code>adonis</code>, <code>anosim</code>, <code>meandist</code> and
<code>mrpp</code> warn on negative dissimilarities, and
<code>betadisper</code> refuses to analyse them. All these functions
expect dissimilarities, and giving something else (like
correlations) probably is a user error.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>betadisper</code> uses restricted permutation of the
<span class="pkg">permute</span> package. 
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>metaMDS</code> uses <code>monoMDS</code> as its default ordination
engine. Function gains new argument <code>engine</code> that can be used
to alternatively select <code>MASS::isoMDS</code>.  The default is not
to use <code>stepacross</code> with <code>monoMDS</code> because its
&lsquo;weak&rsquo; tie treatment can cope with tied maximum
dissimilarities of one. However, <code>stepacross</code> is the default
with <code>isoMDS</code> because it cannot handle adequately these tied
maximum dissimilarities.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>specaccum</code> gained <code>predict</code> method which uses
either linear or spline interpolation for data between observed
points. Extrapolation is possible with spline interpolation, but
may make little sense.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>specpool</code> can handle missing values or empty factor
levels in the grouping factor <code>pool</code>.  Now also checks that
the length of the <code>pool</code> matches the number of
observations.
</p>
</ul>

 


<h4>DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT</h4>



<ul>
<li> <p><code>metaMDSrotate</code> was replaced with <code>MDSrotate</code>
that can also handle the results of <code>monoMDS</code>.
</p>
</li>
<li> <p><code>permuted.index2</code> and other &ldquo;new&rdquo; permutation
code was removed in favour of the <span class="pkg">permute</span> package. This code
was not intended for normal use, but packages depending on that
code in <span class="pkg">vegan</span> should instead depend on <span class="pkg">permute</span>.
</p>
</ul>
  
 


<h4>ANALYSES</h4>



<ul>
<li> <p><code>treeheight</code> uses much snappier code. The results
should be unchanged.
</p>
</ul>
