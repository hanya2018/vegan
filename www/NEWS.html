<h3>Changes in version 2.0-2</h3>

<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>
<ul>
  <li> Function <code>capscale</code> failed if constrained component
    had zero rank. This happened most likely in partial models when
    the conditions aliased constraints. The problem was observed in
    <code>anova(..., by ="margin")</code> which uses partial models to
    analyses the marginal effects, and was raported in an email
    message to
    <a href="https://stat.ethz.ch/pipermail/r-help/2011-October/293077.html">R-News mailing list</a>.
  </li>
  <li><code>stressplot</code> and <code>goodness</code> sometimes failed when
    <code>metaMDS</code> was based on <code>isoMDS</code> (<span class="pkg">MASS</span> package)
    because <code>metaMDSdist</code> did not use the same defaults for
    step-across (extended) dissimilarities as <code>metaMDS(...,
      engine = "isoMDS")</code>. The change of defaults can also influence
    triggering of step-across in <code>capscale(..., metaMDSdist =
      TRUE)</code>.
    <li><code>adonis</code> contained a minor bug resulting from incomplete
      implementation of a speed-up that did not affect the results. In
      fixing this bug, a further bug was identified in transposing the hat
      matrices. This second bug was only active following fixing of the
      first bug. In fixing both bugs, a speed-up in the internal f.test()
      function is fully realised. Reported by Nicholas Lewin-Koh.
    </li>
</ul>

<h4>NEW FEATURES</h4>

<ul>
  <li> <code>ordiarrows</code> and <code>ordisegments</code> gained argument
    <code>order.by</code> that gives a variable to sort points within
    <code>groups</code>. Earlier the points were assumed to be in order.
  </li>
  <li>Function <code>ordispider</code> invisibly returns the
    coordinates to which the points were connected.  Typically these
    are class centroids of each point, but for constrained ordination
    with no <code>groups</code> they are the LC scores.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes in version 2.0-1</h3>

<h4>NEW FUNCTIONS</h4>

<ul>
  <li> <code>clamtest</code>: new function to classify species as
    generalists and specialists in two distinct habitats (CLAM test of
    Chazdon et al., <em>Ecology</em> 92, 1332&ndash;1343; 2011).  The test is
    based on multinomial distribution of individuals in two habitat
    types or sampling units, and it is applicable only to count data
    with no over-dispersion.
  </li>
  <li><code>as.preston</code> gained <code>plot</code> and <code>lines</code>
    methods, and <code>as.fisher</code> gained <code>plot</code> method (which
    also can add items to existing plots). These are similar as
    <code>plot</code> and <code>lines</code> for <code>prestonfit</code> and
    <code>fisherfit</code>, but display only data without the fitted lines.
  </li>
  <li><code>raupcrick</code>: new function to implement Raup-Crick
    dissimilarity as a probability of number of co-occurring species
    with occurrence probabilities proportional to species
    frequencies.  <span class="pkg">Vegan</span> has Raup-Crick index as a choice in
    <code>vegdist</code>, but that uses equal sampling probabilities for
    species and analytic equations. The new <code>raupcrick</code>
    function uses simulation with <code>oecosimu</code>. The function
    follows Chase et al. (2011) <em>Ecosphere</em> 2:art24
    [<a href="http://www.esajournals.org/doi/abs/10.1890/ES10-00117.1">doi:10.1890/ES10-00117.1</a>],
    and was developed with the consultation of Brian Inouye.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>BUG FIXES</h4>

<ul>
  <li> Function <code>meandist</code> could scramble items and give
    wrong results, especially when the <code>grouping</code> was
    numerical. The problem was reported by Dr Miguel Alvarez
    (Univ. Bonn).
  </li>
  <li><code>metaMDS</code> did not reset <code>tries</code> when a new model
    was started with a <code>previous.best</code> solution from a different
    model.
  </li>
  <li>Function <code>permatswap</code> for community null models using
    quantitative swap never swapped items in a <em>2 by 2</em>
    submatrix if all cells were filled.
  </li>
  <li>The result from <code>permutest.cca</code> could not be
    <code>update</code>d because of a &lsquo;<span class="file">NAMESPACE</span>&rsquo; issue.
  </li>
  <li><font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> 2.14.0 changed so that it does not accept using
    <code>sd()</code> function for matrices (which was the behaviour at
    least since <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> 1.0-0), and several <span class="pkg">vegan</span> functions were
    changed to adapt to this change (<code>rda</code>, <code>capscale</code>,
    <code>simulate</code> methods for <code>rda</code>, <code>cca</code> and
    <code>capscale</code>). The change in <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> 2.14.0 does not influence the
    results but you probably wish to upgrade <span class="pkg">vegan</span> to 
    avoid annoying warnings.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>ANALYSES</h4>

<ul>
  <li> <code>nesteddisc</code> is slacker and hence faster when trying
    to optimize the statistic for tied column frequencies. Tracing
    showed that in most cases an improved ordering was found rather
    early in tries, and the results are equally good in most cases.
  </li>
</ul>

<h3>Changes in version 2.0-0</h3>

<h4>GENERAL</h4>

<ul>
  <li> Peter Minchin joins the <span class="pkg">vegan</span> team.
  </li>
  <li><span class="pkg">vegan</span> implements standard <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> &lsquo;<span class="file">NAMESPACE</span>&rsquo;. In
    general, <code>S3</code> methods are not exported which means that you
    cannot directly use or see contents of functions like
    <code>cca.default</code>, <code>plot.cca</code> or <code>anova.ccabyterm</code>. To
    use these functions you should rely on <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font> delegation and simply
    use <code>cca</code> and for its result objects use <code>plot</code> and
    <code>anova</code> without suffix <code>.cca</code>. To see the contents of
    the function you can use <code>:::</code>, such as
    <code>vegan:::cca.default</code>. This change may break packages,
    documents or scripts that rely on non-exported names.
  </li>
  <li><span class="pkg">vegan</span> depends on the <span class="pkg">permute</span> package. This
    package provides powerful tools for restricted permutation
    schemes. All <span class="pkg">vegan</span> permutation will gradually move to use
    <span class="pkg">permute</span>, but currently only <code>betadisper</code> uses the new
    feature.
  </li> 
</ul>

<h4>NEW FUNCTIONS</h4>

<ul>
  <li> <code>monoMDS</code>: a new function for non-metric
    multidimensional scaling (NMDS). This function replaces
    <code>MASS::isoMDS</code> as the default method in
    <code>metaMDS</code>. Major advantages of <code>monoMDS</code> are that it
    has &lsquo;weak&rsquo; (&lsquo;primary&rsquo;) tie treatment which means
    that it can split tied observed dissimilarities.  &lsquo;Weak&rsquo;
    tie treatment improves ordination of heterogeneous data sets,
    because maximum dissimilarities of <i>1</i> can be split. In
    addition to global NMDS, <code>monoMDS</code> can perform local and
    hybrid NMDS and metric MDS.  It can also handle missing and zero
    dissimilarities.  Moreover, <code>monoMDS</code> is faster than
    previous alternatives. The function uses <code>Fortran</code> code
    written by Peter Minchin.
  </li>
  <li><code>MDSrotate</code> a new function to replace
    <code>metaMDSrotate</code>. This function can rotate both
    <code>metaMDS</code> and <code>monoMDS</code> results so that the first
    axis is parallel to an environmental vector.
  </li>
  <li><code>eventstar</code> finds the minimum of the evenness profile
    on the Tsallis entropy, and uses this to find the corresponding
    values of diversity, evenness and numbers equivalent following
    Mendes et al. (<em>Ecography</em> 31, 450-456; 2008). The code was
    contributed by Eduardo Ribeira Cunha and Heloisa Beatriz Antoniazi
    Evangelista and adapted to <span class="pkg">vegan</span> by Peter 
    Solymos.
  </li>
  <li><code>fitspecaccum</code> fits non-linear regression models to
    the species accumulation results from <code>specaccum</code>. The
    function can use new self-starting species accumulation models
    in <span class="pkg">vegan</span> or other self-starting non-linear
    regression models in <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>.
    The function can fit Arrhenius, Gleason, Gitay, Lomolino 
    (in <span class="pkg">vegan</span>), asymptotic, Gompertz,
    Michaelis-Menten, logistic and Weibull (in base <font face="Courier New,Courier" color="#666666"><b>R</b></font>) models. The
    function has <code>plot</code> and <code>predict</code> methods.
  </li>
  <li>Self-starting non-linear species accumulation models
    <code>SSarrhenius</code>, <code>SSgleason</code>, <code>SSgitay</code> and
    <code>SSlomolino</code>. These can be used with <code>fitspecaccum</code> or
    directly in non-linear regression with <code>nls</code>. These functions
    were implemented because they were found good for species-area
    models by Dengler (<em>J. Biogeogr.</em> 36, 728-744; 2009).
</ul>

<h4>NEW FEATURES</h4>

<ul>
  <li> <code>adonis</code>, <code>anosim</code>, <code>meandist</code> and
    <code>mrpp</code> warn on negative dissimilarities, and
    <code>betadisper</code> refuses to analyse them. All these functions
    expect dissimilarities, and giving something else (like
    correlations) probably is a user error.
  </li>
  <li><code>betadisper</code> uses restricted permutation of the
    <span class="pkg">permute</span> package. 
  </li>
  <li><code>metaMDS</code> uses <code>monoMDS</code> as its default ordination
    engine. Function gains new argument <code>engine</code> that can be used
    to alternatively select <code>MASS::isoMDS</code>.  The default is not
    to use <code>stepacross</code> with <code>monoMDS</code> because its
    &lsquo;weak&rsquo; tie treatment can cope with tied maximum
    dissimilarities of one. However, <code>stepacross</code> is the default
    with <code>isoMDS</code> because it cannot handle adequately these tied
    maximum dissimilarities.
  </li>
  <li><code>specaccum</code> gained <code>predict</code> method which uses
    either linear or spline interpolation for data between observed
    points. Extrapolation is possible with spline interpolation, but
    may make little sense.
  </li>
  <li><code>specpool</code> can handle missing values or empty factor
    levels in the grouping factor <code>pool</code>.  Now also checks that
    the length of the <code>pool</code> matches the number of
    observations.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>DEPRECATED AND DEFUNCT</h4>

<ul>
  <li> <code>metaMDSrotate</code> was replaced with <code>MDSrotate</code>
    that can also handle the results of <code>monoMDS</code>.
  </li>
  <li><code>permuted.index2</code> and other &ldquo;new&rdquo; permutation
    code was removed in favour of the <span class="pkg">permute</span> package. 
    This code was not intended for normal use, but packages depending on that
    code in <span class="pkg">vegan</span> should instead depend on
    <span class="pkg">permute</span>.
  </li>
</ul>

<h4>ANALYSES</h4>

<ul>
  <li> <code>treeheight</code> uses much snappier code. The results
    should be unchanged.
  </li>
</ul>
