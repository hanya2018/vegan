\title{ Ecological Diversity Indices and Rarefaction Species Richness }

\description{ Shannon, Simpson, and Fisher diversity indices
and rarefied species richness for community ecologists.  }

\usage{
diversity(x, index = "shannon", MARGIN = 1, base = exp(1))
rarefy(x, sample, se = FALSE, MARGIN = 1)
fisher.alpha(x, MARGIN = 1, se = FALSE, ...)
specnumber(x, MARGIN = 1)
}

\arguments{
  \item{x}{Community data matrix.}
  \item{index}{Diversity index, one of \code{shannon}, \code{simpson} or
  \code{invsimpson}.}
  \item{MARGIN}{Margin for which the index is computed. }
  \item{base}{ The logarithm \code{base} used in \code{shannon}.}
  \item{sample}{Subsample size for rarefying community.}
  \item{se}{Estimate standard errors.}
  \item{...}{Parameters passed to \code{\link{nlm}}}
}
\details{
  Shannon or Shannon--Weaver (or Shannon--Wiener) index is defined as
  \eqn{H' = -\sum_i p_i \log_{b} p_i}{H = -sum p_i log(b) p_i}, where
  \eqn{p_i} is the proportional abundance of species \eqn{i} and \eqn{b}
  is the base of the logarithm.  It is most popular to use natural
  logarithms, but some argue for base \eqn{b = 2} (which makes sense, but no
  real difference).

  Both variants of Simpson's index are based on \eqn{D = \sum p_i^2}{D =
    sum p_i^2}. Choice \code{simpson} returns \eqn{1-D} and
  \code{invsimpson} returns \eqn{1/D}.
 
  Function \code{rarefy} gives the expected species richness in random
  subsamples of size \code{sample} from the community. The size of
  \code{sample} should be smaller than total community size, but the
  function will  silently work for larger \code{sample} as well and
  return non-rarefied species richness (and standard error = 0).
  Rarefaction can be performed only with genuine counts of individuals.
  The function \code{rarefy} is based on Hurlbert's (1971) formulation,
  and the standard errors on Heck et al. (1975).  

  Function \code{fisher.alpha} estimates the \eqn{\alpha} parameter of
  Fisher's logarithmic series (see \code{\link{fisherfit}}). 
  The estimation is possible only for genuine
  counts of individuals. The function can optionally return standard
  errors of \eqn{\alpha}.  These should be regarded only as rough
  indicators of the accuracy: the confidence limits of \eqn{\alpha} are
  strongly
  non-symmetric and standard errors cannot be used in Normal inference.

  Function \code{specnumber} finds the number of species. With
  \code{MARGIN = 2}, it finds frequencies of species. The function is
  extremely simple, and shortcuts are easy in plain \R.
  
  Better stories can be told about Simpson's index than about
  Shannon's index, and still grander narratives about
  rarefaction (Hurlbert 1971).  However, these indices are all very
  closely related (Hill 1973), and there is no reason to despise one more than
  others (but if you are a graduate student, don't drag me in, but obey
  your Professor's orders). In particular, exponent of the Shannon
  index is linearly related to inverse Simpson (Hill 1973) although the
  former may be more sensitive to rare species. Moreover, inverse
  Simpson is asymptotically equal to rarefied species richness in sample
  of two individuals, and Fisher's \eqn{\alpha} is very similar to
  inverse Simpson.

\value{
  Vector of diversity indices or rarefied species richness values. With
  option \code{se = TRUE}, function \code{rarefy} returns a 2-row matrix
  with rarefied richness (\code{S}) and its standard error
  (\code{se}).
  With option \code{se = TRUE}, function \code{fisher.alpha} returns a
  data frame with items for \eqn{\alpha} (\code{alpha}), its approximate
  standard errors (\code{se}), residual degrees of freedom
  (\code{df.residual}), and the \code{code} returned by
  \code{\link{nlm}} on the success of estimation. }
