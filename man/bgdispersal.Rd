\title{ Coefficients of Biogeographical Dispersal Direction }

\description{ This function computes coefficients of dispersal direction
between geographically connected areas, as defined by Legendre and
Legendre (1984), and also described in Legendre and Legendre (1998,
section 13.3.4). }

\usage{
bgdispersal(mat, PAonly = FALSE)
}

\arguments{
\item{mat}{ Data frame or matrix containing a community composition data table
(species presence-absence or abundance data) }
\item{PAonly}{ \code{FALSE} if the four types of coefficients, DD1 to
  DD4, are requested; \code{TRUE} if DD1 and DD2 only are sought (see Details). }
}
\details{
The signs of the DD coefficients indicate the 
direction of dispersal, provided that the 
asymmetry is significant. A positive sign 
indicates dispersal from the first (row in DD 
tables) to the second region (column); a negative 
sign indicates the opposite. A McNemar test of 
asymmetry is computed from the presence-absence 
data to test the hypothesis of a significant 
asymmetry between the two areas under comparison.

In the input data table, the rows are sites or 
areas, the columns are taxa. Most often, the taxa 
are species, but the coefficients can be computed 
from genera or families as well. DD1 and DD2 only 
are computed for presence-absence data. The four 
types of coefficients are computed for 
quantitative data, which are converted to 
presence-absence for the computation of DD1 and 
DD2. \code{PAonly = FALSE} indicates that the four types 
of coefficients are requested. \code{PAonly = TRUE} if DD1 
and DD2 only are sought. }


\value{
Function \code{bgdispersal} returns a list containing the following matrices:
\item{ DD1 }{ \eqn{DD1[j,k] = (a * (b - c))/((a + b + c)^2)} }
\item{ DD2 }{ \eqn{DD2[j,k] = (2*a * (b - c))/((2*a + b + c) * (a + b +
    c))}
  where \eqn{a}, \eqn{b}, and \eqn{c} have the 
same meaning as in the computation of binary 
similarity coefficients. }
\item{ DD3 }{ DD3[j,k] = \eqn{W*(A-B) / ((A+B-W)^2)} }
\item{ DD4 }{ DD4[j,k] = \eqn{2*W*(A-B) / ((A+B)*(A+B-W)})
where \code{W = sum(pmin(vector1, vector2))}, \code{A = sum(vector1)}, \code{B = sum(vector2)} }
\item{ McNemar }{ McNemar chi-square statistic of 
asymmetry with correction for continuity (Siegel 
and Castellan 1988): \eqn{(abs(b - c) - 1)^2 / (b + c)} 
}
\item{ prob.McNemar }{ probabilities associated 
with McNemar statistics, chi-square test. H0: no 
asymmetry in \eqn{(b-c)}. }
