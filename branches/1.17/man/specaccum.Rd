\title{Species Accumulation Curves }
\description{
  Function \code{specaccum} finds species accumulation curves or the
  number of species for a certain number of sampled sites or
  individuals. 
}
\usage{
specaccum(comm, method = "exact", permutations = 100,
          conditioned =TRUE, gamma = "jack1",  ...)
\method{plot}{specaccum}(x, add = FALSE, ci = 2, ci.type = c("bar", "line", "polygon"), 
    col = par("fg"), ci.col = col, ci.lty = 1, xlab, 
    ylab = x$method, ylim, xvar = c("sites", "individuals"), ...)
\method{boxplot}{specaccum}(x, add = FALSE, ...)
}

\arguments{
  \item{comm}{Community data set.}
  \item{method}{Species accumulation method (partial match). Method
    \code{"collector"}
    adds sites in the order they happen to be in the data,
    \code{"random"} adds sites in random order, \code{"exact"} finds the
    expected (mean) species richness, \code{"coleman"} finds the
    expected richness following
    Coleman et al. 1982, and \code{"rarefaction"} finds the mean when
    accumulating individuals instead of sites.  }

      "random"}.}
  \item{conditioned}{ Estimation of standard deviation is conditional on
    the empirical dataset for the exact SAC}

    survey area by function \code{\link{specpool}}} 
  \item{x}{A \code{specaccum} result object}
  \item{add}{Add to an existing graph.}
  \item{ci}{Multiplier used to get confidence intervals from standard
    deviation (standard error of the estimate). Value \code{ci = 0}
    suppresses drawing confidence intervals.}
  \item{ci.type}{Type of confidence intervals in the graph: \code{"bar"}
    draws vertical bars, \code{"line"} draws lines, and
    \code{"polygon"} draws a shaded area.}

  \item{ylim}{the y limits of the plot.}

\details{
  Species accumulation curves (SAC) are used to compare diversity properties
  of community data sets using different accumulator functions. The
  classic method is \code{"random"} which finds the mean SAC and its
  standard deviation from random permutations of the data, or
  subsampling without replacement (Gotelli & Colwell 2001).
  The \code{"exact"} method finds the
  expected SAC using the method that was independently developed by
  Ugland et al. (2003), Colwell et al. (2004) and Kindt et al. (2006). 
  The unconditional standard deviation for the exact SAC represents a
  moment-based estimation that is not conditioned on the empirical data
  set (sd for all samples > 0), unlike the conditional standard deviation
  that was developed by Jari Oksanen (not published, sd=0 for all
  samples). The unconditional standard deviation is based on an estimation
  of the total extrapolated number of species in the survey area
  (a.k.a. gamma diversity), as estimated by
  function \code{\link{specpool}}.
  Method \code{"coleman"} finds the expected SAC and its standard
  deviation following Coleman et al. (1982).  All these methods are
  based on sampling sites without replacement. In contrast, the
  \code{method = "rarefaction"} finds the expected species richness and
  its standard deviation by sampling individuals instead of sites. It
  achieves this by applying function \code{\link{rarefy}} with number of individuals
  corresponding to average number of individuals per site.

  The function has a \code{plot} method. In addition, \code{method =
    "random"} has \code{summary} and \code{boxplot} methods. 
}

\value{
  The function returns an object of class \code{"specaccum"} with items:
  \item{call }{Function call.}
  \item{method}{Accumulator method.}
  \item{sites}{Number of sites.  For \code{method = "rarefaction"} this
    is the number of sites corresponding to a certain number of
    individuals and generally not an integer, and the average
    number of individuals is also returned in item \code{individuals}.} 
  \item{richness}{The number of species corresponding to number of
    sites.  With \code{method = "collector"} this is the observed
    richness, for other methods the average or expected richness.}
  \item{sd}{The standard deviation of SAC (or its standard error). This
    is \code{NULL} in \code{method = "collector"}, and it
    is estimated from permutations in \code{method = "random"}, and from
    analytic equations in other methods.}
  \item{perm}{Permutation results with \code{method = "random"} and
    \code{NULL} in other cases. Each column in \code{perm} holds one
    permutation.}

\note{
  The SAC with \code{method = "exact"} was
  developed by Roeland Kindt, and its standard deviation by Jari
  Oksanen (both are unpublished). The \code{method = "coleman"}
  underestimates the SAC because it does not handle properly sampling
  without replacement.  Further, its standard deviation does not take
  into account species correlations, and is generally too low. }
