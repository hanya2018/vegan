\title{Multivariate homogeneity of groups dispersions (variances)}
\description{
  Implements Marti Anderson's PERMDISP2 procedure for the analysis of
  multivariate homogeneity of group dispersions (variances).
  \code{betadisper} is a multivariate analogue of Levene's test for
  homogeneity of variances. Non-euclidean distances between objects and
  group centroids are handled by reducing the original distances to
  principal coordinates.

\usage{
betadisper(d, group, type = c("centroid", "median"))

\method{anova}{betadisper}(object, \dots)

permDisper(object, control = permControl(nperm = 999))

       choices = c(1,2), \dots)

\details{
  One measure of multivariate dispersion (variance) for a group of
  samples is to calculate the average distance of group members to the
  group centroid or spatial median in multivariate space. To test if the
  dispersions (variances) of one or more groups are different, the
  distances of group members to the group centroid are subject to
  ANOVA. This is a multivariate analogue of Levene's test for
  homogeneity of variances if the distances between group members and
  group centroids is the Euclidean distance.

  However, better measures of distance than the Euclidean distance are
  available for ecological data. These can be accomodated by reducing
  the distances produced using any dissimilarity coefficient to
  principal coordinates to embed them within a Euclidean space. The
  analysis proceeds by calculating the Euclidean distances between group
  members and the group centroid on the basis of the principal
  coordinate axes rather than the original distances.

  Non-metric dissimilarity coefficients can produce principal coordinate
  axes that have negative Eigenvalues. These correspond to the
  imaginary, non-metric part of the distance between objects. If
  negative Eigenvalues are produced, we must correct for these imaginary
  distances.

  To test if one or more groups is more variable than the others, ANOVA
  of the distances to group centroids can be performed, and parametric
  theory used to interpret the significance of F. An alternative is to
  use a permutation test. \code{permDisper} permutes model residuals to
  generate a permutation distribution of F under the Null hypothesis of
  no difference in dispersion between groups.

  The results of the analysis can be visualised using the plot and
  boxplot methods.

  One additional use of these functions is in assessing beta diversity
  (Anderson \emph{et al} 2006).

\value{
  The \code{anova} method returns an object of class \code{"anova"}
  inheriting from class \code{"data.frame"}.

  \code{permDisp} returns an object of class \code{"permDisper"}
  inheriting from class \code{"data.frame"}.

  The \code{scores} method returns a list with one or both of the
  components \code{"sites"} and \code{"centroids"}.
  
  The \code{plot} function invisibly returns an object of class
  \code{"ordiplot"}, a plotting structure which can be used by function
  \code{\link{identify.ordiplot}} to identify the points or other
  functions in the \code{\link{ordiplot}} family. 

  The \code{boxplot} function invisibly returns a list whose components
  are documented in \code{\link[graphics]{boxplot}}.

  \code{betadisper} returns a list of class \code{"betadisper"} with the
  following components:

  \item{eig}{numeric; the eigenvalues of the principal coordinates
    analyis.}
  \item{vectors}{matrix; the eigenvectors of the principal coordinates
    analyis.}
  \item{distances}{numeric; the Euclidean distances in principal
    coordinate space between the samples and their respective group
    centroid.}
  \item{group}{factor; vector describing the group structure}
  \item{centroids}{matrix; the locations of the group centroids on the
    principal coordinates.}
  \item{call}{the matched function call.}
