\title{[Partial] Constrained Analysis of Principal Coordinates or
  distance-based RDA }
\description{
  Constrained Analysis of Principal Coordinates (CAP) is an ordination method
  similar to Redundancy Analysis (\code{\link{rda}}), but it allows
  non-Euclidean dissimilarity indices, such as Manhattan or
  Bray--Curtis distance. Despite this non-Euclidean feature, the analysis
  is strictly linear and metric. If called with Euclidean distance,
  the results are identical to \code{\link{rda}}, but \code{capscale}
  will be much more inefficient. Function \code{capscale} is a
  constrained version of metric scaling, a.k.a. principal coordinates
  analysis, which is based on the Euclidean distance but can be used,
  and is more useful, with other dissimilarity measures. The function
  can also perform unconstrained principal coordinates analysis,
  optionally using extended dissimilarities.
}
\usage{
capscale(formula, data, distance = "euclidean", comm = NULL,
         add = FALSE,  dfun = vegdist, metaMDSdist = FALSE, ...)
}

\arguments{
  \item{formula}{Model formula. The function can be called only with the
    formula interface. Most usual features of \code{\link{formula}} hold,
    especially as defined in \code{\link{cca}} and \code{\link{rda}}. The
    LHS must be either a community data matrix or a dissimilarity matrix,
    e.g., from
    \code{\link{vegdist}} or \code{\link{dist}}.
    If the LHS is a data matrix, function \code{\link{vegdist}}
    will be used to find the dissimilarities. The RHS defines the
    constraints. The constraints can be continuous variables or factors,
    they can be transformed within the formula, and they can have
    interactions as in a typical \code{\link{formula}}. The RHS can have a
    special term \code{Condition} that defines variables to be
    ``partialled out'' before constraints, just like in \code{\link{rda}}
    or \code{\link{cca}}. This allows the use of partial CAP.}
  \item{data}{ Data frame containing the variables on the right hand side of
    the model formula. }
  \item{distance}{Dissimilarity (or distance) index  in
    \code{\link{vegdist}} used if the LHS of the \code{formula} is a
    data frame instead of dissimilarity matrix. }
  \item{comm}{ Community data frame which will be used for finding
    species scores when the LHS of the \code{formula} was a
    dissimilarity matrix. This is not used if the LHS is a data
    frame. If this is not supplied, the ``species scores'' are the axes
    of initial metric scaling (\code{\link{cmdscale}}) and may be
    confusing.}
  \item{add}{Logical indicating if an additive constant should be
     computed, and added to the non-diagonal dissimilarities such
     that all eigenvalues are non-negative in the underlying
     Principal Co-ordinates Analysis (see \code{\link{cmdscale}} 
     for details). This implements \dQuote{correction method 2} of
     Legendre & Legendre (1998, p. 434). The negative eigenvalues are
     caused by using semi-metric or non-metric dissimilarities with
     basically metric \code{\link{cmdscale}}. They are harmless and
     ignored in \code{capscale}, but you also can avoid warnings with
     this option. }
   \item{dfun}{Distance or dissimilarity function used. Any function
     returning standard \code{"dist"} and taking the index name as the
     first argument can be used. }
   \item{metaMDSdist}{Use \code{\link{metaMDSdist}} similarly as in
     \code{\link{metaMDS}}. This means automatic data transformation and
     using extended flexible shortest path dissimilarities (function
     \code{\link{stepacross}}) when there are many dissimilarities based on
     no shared species.}
   \item{\dots}{Other parameters passed to \code{\link{rda}} or to
     \code{\link{metaMDSdist}}.  }
}
\details{
  Canonical Analysis of Principal Coordinates (CAP) is simply a
  Redundancy Analysis of results of Metric (Classical) Multidimensional
  Scaling (Anderson & Willis 2003). Function capscale uses two steps:
  (1) it ordinates the dissimilarity matrix using
  \code{\link{cmdscale}} and (2) analyzes these results using
  \code{\link{rda}}. If the user supplied a community data frame instead
  of dissimilarities, the function will find the needed dissimilarity
  matrix using \code{\link{vegdist}} with specified
  \code{distance}. However, the method will accept dissimilarity
  matrices from \code{\link{vegdist}}, \code{\link{dist}}, or any
  other method producing similar matrices. The constraining variables can be
  continuous or factors or both, they can have interaction terms,
  or they can be transformed in the call. Moreover, there can be a
  special term
  \code{Condition} just like in \code{\link{rda}} and \code{\link{cca}}
  so that ``partial'' CAP can be performed.

  The current implementation  differs from the method suggested by
  Anderson & Willis (2003) in three major points which actually make it
  similar to distance-based redundancy analysis (Legendre & Anderson
  1999):
  \enumerate{
    \item Anderson & Willis used the orthonormal solution of
    \code{\link{cmdscale}}, whereas \code{capscale} uses axes
    weighted by corresponding eigenvalues, so that the ordination
    distances are the best approximations of original
    dissimilarities. In the original method, later ``noise'' axes are
    just as important as first major axes.
    \item Anderson & Willis take only a subset of axes, whereas 
    \code{capscale} uses all axes with positive eigenvalues. The use of
    subset is necessary with orthonormal axes to chop off some
    ``noise'', but the use of all axes guarantees that the results are
    the best approximation of original dissimilarities.
    \item Function \code{capscale} adds species scores as weighted sums
    of (residual) community matrix (if the matrix is available), whereas
    Anderson & Willis have no fixed method for adding species scores.
  }
  With these definitions, function \code{capscale} with Euclidean
  distances will be identical to \code{\link{rda}} in eigenvalues and
  in site, species and biplot scores (except for possible sign
  reversal). 
  However, it makes no sense to use \code{capscale} with
  Euclidean distances, since direct use of \code{\link{rda}} is much more
  efficient. Even with non-Euclidean dissimilarities, the
  rest of the analysis will be metric and linear.

  The function can be also used to perform ordinary metric scaling
  a.k.a. principal coordinates analysis by using a formula with only a
  constant on the left hand side, or \code{comm ~ 1}. With
  \code{metaMDSdist = TRUE}, the function can do automatic data
  standardization and use extended dissimilarities using function
  \code{\link{stepacross}} similary as in non-metric multidimensional
  scaling with \code{\link{metaMDS}}. 
  
}
\value{
  The function returns an object of class \code{capscale} which is
  identical to the result of \code{\link{rda}}. At the moment,
  \code{capscale} does not have specific methods, but it uses
  \code{\link{cca}} and \code{\link{rda}} methods
  \code{\link{plot.cca}},
  \code{\link{scores.rda}}  etc. Moreover, you
  can use \code{\link{anova.cca}} for permutation tests of
  ``significance'' of the results.

\note{
  Warnings of negative eigenvalues are issued with most dissimilarity
  indices.  These are harmless, and negative eigenvalues will be ignored
  in the analysis.  If the warnings are disturbing, you can use argument
  \code{add = TRUE} passed to \code{\link{cmdscale}}, or, preferably, a
  distance measure that does not cause these warnings.  In
  \code{\link{vegdist}}, \code{method = "jaccard"} gives such an index.
  Alternatively, after square root transformation many indices do not
  cause warnings.
  
  Function \code{\link{rda}} usually divides the ordination scores by
  number of sites minus one. In this way, the inertia is variance
  instead of sum of squares, and the eigenvalues sum up to
  variance. Many dissimilarity measures are in the range 0 to 1, so they
  have already made a similar division. If the largest original
  dissimilarity is less than or equal to 4 (allowing for
  \code{\link{stepacross}}), this division is undone in \code{capscale}
  and original dissimilarities are used. The inertia is named
  \code{squared dissimilarity} (as defined in the dissimilarity matrix),
  but keyword \code{mean} is added to the inertia in cases where
  division was made, e.g. in Euclidean and Manhattan distances.
