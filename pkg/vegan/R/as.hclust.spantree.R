### Casts a vegan spantree object into single linkage dendrogram of
### class hclust. The non-trivial items in "hclust" object are a
### 'merge' matrix for fusions of points and/or clusters, a 'height'
### vector which gives the heights of each fusion, and an 'order'
### vector that gives the order of leaves in the plotted
### dendrogram. The 'height's are only sorted spantree segment
### distances, but for 'merge' we need to establish cluster
### memberships, and for 'order' we must traverse the tree.

### Reorder an hclust tree. Basic R provides reorder.dendrogram, but
### this functoin works with 'hclust' objects, and also differs in
### implementation. We use either weighted mean, min or max or
### sum. The dendrogram is always ordered in ascending order, so that
### with max the left kid always has lower value. So with 'max' the
### largest value is smaller in leftmost group. The choice 'sum'
### hardly makes sense, but it is the default in
### reorder.dendrogram. The ordering with 'mean' differs from
### reorder.dendrogram which uses unweighted means, but here we weight
### means by group sizes so that the mean of an internal node is the
### mean of its leaves.

`reorder.hclust` <-
    function(x, wts,
             agglo.FUN = c("mean", "min", "max", "sum", "uwmean"),
