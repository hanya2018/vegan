\title{ Nestedness Indices for Communities of Islands or Patches }

\description{
  Patches or local communities are regarded as nested if they all could
  be subsets of the same community. In general, species poor communities
  should be subsets of species rich communities, and rare species should
  only occur in species rich communities. 
}

\usage{
nestedchecker(comm)
nestedn0(comm)
nesteddisc(comm)
nestedtemp(comm, ...)
nestednodf(comm, order = TRUE)
\method{plot}{nestedtemp}(x, kind = c("temperature", "incidendce"),
    col=rev(heat.colors(100)),  names = FALSE, ...)
}

\arguments{
  \item{comm}{Community data. }
  \item{x}{Result object for a \code{plot}.}
  \item{col}{Colour scheme for matrix temperatures.}
  \item{kind}{The kind of plot produced.}
  \item{names}{Label columns and rows in the plot using names in \code{comm}.
    If it is a logical vector of length 2, row and column labels are
    returned accordingly.}
  \item{order}{Order rows and columns by frequencies.}
  \item{\dots}{Other arguments to functions.}
}

\details{
  The nestedness functions evaluate alternative indices of nestedness.
  The functions are intended to be used together with Null model
  communities and used as an argument in \code{\link{oecosimu}} to analyse
  the nonrdanomness of results.
  
  Function \code{netstedchecker} gives the number of checkerboard units,
  or 2x2 submatrices where both species occur once but on different
  sites (Stone & Roberts 1990).

  Function \code{nestedn0} implements
  nestedness measure N0 which is the number of absences from the sites
  which are richer than the most pauperate site species occurs
  (Patterson & Atmar 1986).

  Function \code{nesteddisc} implements
  discrepancy index which is the number of ones that should be shifted
  to fill a row with ones in a table arranged by species frequencies
  (Brualdi & Sanderson 1999). The original definition arranges species
  (columns) by their frequencies, but did not have any method of
  handling tied frequencies.

  The \code{nesteddisc} function tries to
  order tied columns to minimize the discrepancy statistic but this is
  rather slow, and with a large number of tied columns there is no
  guarantee that the best ordering was found. In that case a warning
  of tied columns will be issued.

  Function \code{nestedtemp} finds the
  matrix temperature which is defined as the sum of \dQuote{surprises}
  in arranged matrix.  In arranged unsurprising matrix all species
  within proportion given by matrix fill are in the upper left corner of
  the matrix, and the surprise of the absence or presences is the
  diagonal distance from the fill line (Atmar & Patterson
  1993). Function tries to pack species and sites to a low
  temperature (\enc{Rodríguez-Gironés}{Rodriguez-Girones} & Santamaria
  2006), but this is an iterative procedure, and the temperatures
  usually vary among runs.  Function \code{nestedtemp} also has a
  \code{plot} method which can display either incidences or temperatures
  of the surprises. Matrix temperature was rather vaguely described
  (Atmar & Patterson 1993), but
  \enc{Rodríguez-Gironés}{Rodriguez-Girones} & Santamaria (2006) are
  more explicit and their description is used here. However, the results
  probably differ from other implementations, and users should be
  cautious in interpreting the results. The details of calculations
  are explained in the \code{\link{vignette}} \emph{Design decisions
  and implementation} that you can read using functions
  \code{\link{vignette}} or \code{\link{vegandocs}}.

  Function \code{nestednodf} implements a nestedness metric based on
  overlap and decreasing fill (Almeida-Neto et al., 2008). Two basic
  properties are required for a matrix to have the maximum degree of
  nestedness according to this metric: (1) complete overlap of 1's from
  right to left columns and from down to up rows, and (2) decreasing
  marginal totals between all pairs of columns and all pairs of
  rows. The nestedness statistic is evaluated separately for columns
  (\code{N columns}) for rows (\code{N rows}) and combined for the whole
  matrix (\code{NODF}).  If you set \code{order = FALSE}, the statistic
  is evaluated with the current matrix ordering allowing tests of other
  meaningful hypothesis of matrix structure than ordering by row and
  column totals (see Almeida-Neto et al. 2008).
}

\value{
  The result returned by a nestedness function contains an item called
  \code{statistic}, but the other components differ among functions. The
  functions are constructed so that they can be handled by
  \code{\link{oecosimu}}.
