permute ChangeLog

Version 0.5-0 (opened June 17, 2011)

	* shuffle: renamed permuted.index() to shuffle()
	* Vignette: the package has a vignette, which is very much
	a work-in-progress.

Version 0.0-3 (closed June 17, 2011)

	* NAMESPACE: permute gets a NAMESPACE. Needed to shield
	functions form ones of similar name in vegan.

Version 0.0-2 (closed December 09, 2010)

	* allPerms: Large update. allPerms now works for all
	permutation designs *except* when permuting both blocks
	and within blocks. This exception is handled with
	.NotYetImplemented().

	* numPerms: Wasn't returning the correct number of
	permutations when WITHIN == "none" and BLOCK != "none",
	i.e. permuting strata.

	* Utils: Utility functions defined inline within allPerms
	moved to new proper functions and renamed; allFree, allSeries
	allGrid, allStrata.

Version 0.0-1 (closed February 28, 2010)

	* SVN: Uploaded code to r-forge within vegan source tree.
	This code base represents my working version as of today,
	*not* the version in vegan at that time.
