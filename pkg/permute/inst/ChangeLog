permute ChangeLog

Version 0.0-2 (open February 28, 2010)

	* numPerms: Wasn't returning the correct number of
	permutations when WITHIN == "none" and BLOCK != "none",
	i.e. permuting strata.

	* Utils: Utility functions defined inline within allPerms
	moved to new proper functions and renamed; allFree, allSeries
	allGrid, allStrata.

Version 0.0-1 (closed February 28, 2010)

	* SVN: Uploaded code to r-forge within vegan source tree.
	This code base represents my working version as of today,
	*not* the version in vegan at that time.
