Description: Restricted experimental designs are commonly encountered
             in ecological data. Ordination analyses of such data are
             generally tested using permutation tests. The 'permute' 
             package implements a set of restricted permutation designs
             for freely exchangeable, line transects (time series), and 
             spatial grid designs plus permutation of blocks (groups of 
             samples). 'permute' also allows split-plot designs, in which 
             the whole-plots or split-plots or both can be freely-exchangeble
             or one of the restricted designs.
